In Jodorowsky&amp;rsquo;s Dune, director Frank Pavich documented the Chilean-French maverick&amp;rsquo;s unhinged (and ultimately abortive) effort to mount a screen adaptation with a projected 14-hour running time, featuring a starring role for Salvador Dal&amp;iacute; and a burning giraffe. Really. Crucially, Pavich&amp;rsquo;s engrossing doc suggested that although Jodorowsky&amp;rsquo;s film never actually existed, it still cast a long creative shadow, with the pre-production work of the French graphic novelist Moebius and Swiss artist HR Giger influencing Star Wars, Alien and pretty much all subsequent screen sci-fi, a claim that cannot be made about David Lynch&amp;rsquo;s finished but fatally flawed 1984 version.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 24pt;&quot;&gt;Now,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;the French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, whose impressive genre CV includes Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, has made a bold stab at proving that Herbert&amp;rsquo;s book may not be unfilmable after all. Opening with the words &amp;ldquo;Part One&amp;rdquo; and closing with a declaration that &amp;ldquo;this is just the beginning&amp;rdquo;, Villeneuve&amp;rsquo;s Dune sensibly tackles only one manageable section of the story, avoiding the baffling narrative compressions and ellipses that blighted Lynch&amp;rsquo;s version, while reining in the extravagant excesses that thwarted Jodorowsky before he&amp;rsquo;d even started. Timoth&amp;eacute;e Chalamet does his usual whey-faced Edward Scissorhands impression as Paul Atreides, beset by dreams of Fremen girl Chani (Zendaya) on the planet Arrakis, also known as Dune. Here, the houses of Atreides and Harkonnen vie for control of the &amp;ldquo;spice&amp;rdquo; trade, a magical dust viewed by the desert-dwelling Fremen as &amp;ldquo;the sacred hallucinogen that prolongs life&amp;rdquo; but harvested by off-worlders as the highly prized (and thus highly priced) key to navigating interstellar travel. Villeneuve and co-writers Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth conjure clear plot lines that accent the contemporary colonial parallels; this is a tale in which wealthy overlords battle over mineral resources in a vast sandy region that they find hostile and dangerous yet irresistibly profitable. There&amp;rsquo;s an almost comedic element to early scenes of Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) arriving on Arrakis, heralded by the blaring of bagpipes. Meanwhile, Charlotte Rampling shrouds her admirably straight face behind sinister black lace as Reverend Mother Mohiam, attempting to divine whether Paul is actually the prophesied one (&amp;ldquo;I hope you live,&amp;rdquo; she says dismissively), while Rebecca Ferguson steals the show as Lady Jessica, torn between her desire to protect her son and the mysterious legacy of the Bene Gesserit sisterhood. So much of Herbert&amp;rsquo;s novel has become part of the fabric of popular science fiction that at times Villeneuve&amp;rsquo;s film may seem deceptively derivative. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s the samurai-style swordplay and inner voices of Star Wars or the Matrix-like question of Paul&amp;rsquo;s foretold divinity, many riffs can feel familiar. What makes them new is Villeneuve&amp;rsquo;s astonishing visual sensibility. From ornithopters that flit like dragonflies to vast spaceships that glint in the mist, these are the kind of sights that Roy Batty rhapsodised about in his dying moments in Blade Runner.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Yes, there are explosive action sequences and a booming Hans Zimmer score, but there are also low-key moments that reminded me of the mournful air of Jacques-Louis David&amp;rsquo;s 18th-century painting The Death of Marat. As for the giant sandworms that splash through deserts like eels through water, they are no longer silly but instead spectacular, with credit to visual effects supervisor Paul Lambert and his team. Of course Lynch&amp;rsquo;s Dune contained its fair share of unforgettable sights too, from a steamy Sting posing with wings on his nethers to Kenneth McMillan&amp;rsquo;s pustular Baron Harkonnen floating absurdly through the incoherent madness of the movie. Villeneuve&amp;rsquo;s altogether better behaved version (for better or worse) dials down the crazy, with Stellan Skarsg&amp;aring;rd&amp;rsquo;s baron favouring the bald-head-stroking of Brando&amp;rsquo;s Colonel Kurtz, and even getting a haunting Apocalypse Now face-surfacing-through-watery-slime moment. &amp;ldquo;Dreams make good stories,&amp;rdquo; says Jason Momoa&amp;rsquo;s Duncan Idaho, &amp;ldquo;but everything important happens when we&amp;rsquo;re awake.&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s a line that strikes a chord in a film that, for all its unearthly vistas, still manages to make a surprising amount of sense. Whether that can be sustained remains to be seen &amp;ndash; there are still mountainous narrative hurdles ahead &amp;ndash; but right now, Villeneuve is riding the sinewy worm of Herbert&amp;rsquo;s sacred text with aplomb.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;', 'img/upload/michaeladel1992@gmail.com/e9312a3266ae0b0b41b726992b46ef59.jpg', '2021', 35, 29, '2021/11/01', '{\"like\":1,\"dislike\":0,\"memberLike\":[29],\"memberDislike\":[]}', 61, 2, 29),

It was introduced in 2018&amp;rsquo;s unusually smart Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse before being teased in the trailer for this December&amp;rsquo;s Spider-Man: No Way Home and it will probably be dogging the genre for years to come, appetite or no. The Venom franchise, which started in 2018 and continues with Let There Be Carnage, exists in an unofficial multiverse of its own: one that eradicates the elevated, overly self-serious worlds of Marvel and DC and continues directly on from the flip flashiness of the 90s Batman films and the slick straightforwardness of the 00s Spider-Man franchise.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #121212; font-family: GuardianTextEgyptian, Guardian Text Egyptian Web, Georgia, serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 24pt; color: #34495e;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; first film was a surprisingly fun, if unsurprisingly disposable, throwback adventure that embraced its glaring Happy Meal tie-in goofiness and didn&amp;rsquo;t care for the overcomplicated world-building and portentous tone of more recent comic book fare. It was big and silly and anchored by an everything-thrown-at-the-wall performance from Tom Hardy as a journalist who has to live in the same body as a brain-eating alien, with space for thoughtful actors including Michelle Williams, Riz Ahmed, Jenny Slate and Melora Walters alongside. After it became a bigger hit than expected, gobbling up over $850m worldwide, a sequel was inevitably steered to the screen, with the original director, Ruben Fleischer, replaced by someone who knows all about duality: Andy Serkis. But while Serkis and the returning screenwriter Kelly Marcel have maintained the first film&amp;rsquo;s light zippiness (there&amp;rsquo;s none of that darker sequel nonsense here) and dated idea of cool (The Black Keys&amp;rsquo; Howlin&amp;rsquo; For You is an almost Xavier Dolan-level music choice in one scene), they&amp;rsquo;ve lost almost everything else, a pile of monster mush that should have been left in the lab.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #121212; font-family: GuardianTextEgyptian, Guardian Text Egyptian Web, Georgia, serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;&quot;&gt;Hardy, to his credit, works hard for that big paycheck yet again, not required to show off quite as much manic physicality as before but committing himself to the stupidity of it all with full vigor. This time around, his reporter Eddie Brock (who in one scene appears to also be designing the front page of his newspaper, which is impressive) inadvertently transfers his alien-infused blood to a serial killer, Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson), who escapes execution with the help of his newly acquired tentacles. Calling himself Carnage, he vows to track down Brock and Venom and also his long-lost love, Frances, AKA Shriek (Naomie Harris), whose scream is able to kill those unlucky enough to hear it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #121212; font-family: GuardianTextEgyptian, Guardian Text Egyptian Web, Georgia, serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;&quot;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s all far goofier than it sounds but while Marcel tries to up the ante from the last film in many ways, the mayhem wears thin far too soon. There&amp;rsquo;s a more pronounced lean into the humour of the Venom/Eddie dynamic but the film remains aggressively unfunny throughout, bar some decent sight gags, and so despite the alleged viciousness of Venom (who is desperate to eat brains but has to settle for M&amp;amp;Ms), it often feels like a film for kids who might find something dumb to laugh at among the gristle. There was an (unintentionally?) homoerotic undertone to the first film, amplified in a 2019 comic that had Spider-Man and Venom involved in a jokey scene of sexual flirtation, and Serkis has hinted at how there is a pronounced queerness to the sequel. Venom gets a &amp;ldquo;coming out&amp;rdquo; scene at a party that is &amp;ldquo;sort of an LGBTQIA kind of festival&amp;rdquo;, in his words, but on screen, it&amp;rsquo;s all predictably blurry and ultimately one of many scenes that hints at a more interesting, yet denied, take on the material. The PG-13 Venom movies take cues from R-rated body horror but pull back before things get really gnarly, a sort of frustrating tease of something as loose and wild as these films seem to think they are already. While Hardy emerges unscathed, he&amp;rsquo;s surrounded by actors who get precious little out of the film other than money towards a down payment on a new beach house. Harrelson tries to conjure up some of his Natural Born Killers malevolence but feels miscast for the role, acting younger to seem like he was at a reform school at the same time as his childhood sweetheart, played by the 15-years-younger Harris, who barely gets a look in. Williams understandably sleepwalks through the few scenes she has, much to the envy of us in the audience who are still awake, barely, for a finale that&amp;rsquo;s all sound and fury but no real fun. It&amp;rsquo;s at least a short film, clocking it at around 90 minutes, Serkis chopping off any extraneous fat, but it floats by and floats on without ever causing us to sit up and pay attention. Let there be no more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;', 'img/upload/michaeladel1992@gmail.com/27344d80d218a609f64fa44bd3df36d5.jpg', '2021', 24, 29, '2021/11/01', '{\"like\":0,\"dislike\":1,\"memberLike\":[],\"memberDislike\":[29]}', 2, 2, 29),
(31, 'movie', 'The Suicide Squad', '&lt;p&gt;Many will see James Gunn&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Suicide Squad&amp;rdquo; as a funhouse mirror inversion of the writer/director&amp;rsquo;s work with &amp;ldquo;Guardians of the Galaxy.&amp;rdquo; After all, it&amp;rsquo;s another collection of underdog heroes who overcome all odds to defeat an interstellar enemy. &amp;ldquo;Guardians for Adults&amp;rdquo; wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be entirely incorrect. However, the main influence on this clever action comedy isn&amp;rsquo;t Starlord but The Toxic Avenger. Gunn has brought the B-movie sense of humor and brazenly adult level of violence that he honed working with Troma Entertainment in the 1990s to his first DC adaptation, even giving his mentor Lloyd Kaufman a cameo. Only the man who wrote &amp;ldquo;Tromeo and Juliet&amp;rdquo; could deliver something this gleefully grotesque, vicious, and unapologetic, and the DC Universe is all the better for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Gunn cleverly avoids many of the problems of the opening scenes of David Ayer&amp;rsquo;s take on this corner of the DC Universe by dropping a dozen or so characters into the action (thereby not giving us a repeat of that hour or so of introductions from the Ayer misfire). For the record, this is kind of half-sequel, half-reboot wherein some actors play the same characters but it&amp;rsquo;s also very much a standalone film. You really don&amp;rsquo;t need to have seen the Ayer (and probably shouldn&amp;rsquo;t) but it&amp;rsquo;s also not entirely a fresh start. For example, Viola Davis is one of the returning folks from the last film, once again playing Amanda Waller, the head of something called Task Force X. She is in charge of what is essentially the Suicide Squad, a collection of superpowered criminals who are sent into battle with chips embedded in the back of their heads. Go off mission, go boom. Don&amp;rsquo;t do what you&amp;rsquo;re told, go boom. Say something wrong to Waller, go boom. Most of these anti-heroes don&amp;rsquo;t return. Hence, the name.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Waller has assembled a crew to drop off the shore of a South American island called Corto Maltese. It&amp;rsquo;s led by the charismatic Rick Flag (a solidly heroic Joel Kinnaman, used much more effectively here) and the eternally twisted Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), but also includes the likes Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Blackguard (Pete Davidson), T.D.K. (Nathan Fillion), Javelin (Flula Borg), Mongal (Mayling Ng), and the nightmare fuel called the Weasel (Sean Gunn), which is a wide-eyed, six-foot, well, weasel. Going along to Corto Maltese on his first mission is Savant (Gunn regular Michael Rooker), who kind of leads the film at first. We&amp;rsquo;re just getting started with characters. Take notes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At the same time that this group is heading into certain death, another collection is landing on an opposite beach, basically allowing team one to be the distraction. They&amp;rsquo;re the real center of &amp;ldquo;The Suicide Squad&amp;rdquo; and they consist of the born leader Bloodsport (Idris Elba), the blindly patriotic Peacemaker (John Cena), the insecure Polka-Dot Man (David Dastmalchian), the charming Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior), and the unforgettable King Shark (Sylvester Stallone), whose basic superpower seems to be his desire to eat his enemies (and possibly his friends if it comes to that). When this core is joined by Flag and Quinn, the movie really gets going, sending the team off to destroy a Nazi-era prison in the heart of the island where it turns out a powerful alien creature named Starro is being housed. A lot of chaos ensues.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Chaos is the key aesthetic choice here but directing this kind of sensory assault and not getting lost in the noise is much harder than it looks, and it\'s Gunn&amp;rsquo;s greatest accomplishment here. He never loses the characters in the action like so many poor modern blockbusters tend to do. While it feels like &amp;ldquo;The Suicide Squad&amp;rdquo; is a rollercoaster without brakes, it&amp;rsquo;s actually a very well-calibrated action comedy, alternating humorous beats with bursts of intense violence. On that note, this is the most insanely violent superhero blockbuster yet, making &amp;ldquo;Deadpool&amp;rdquo; look kind of sweet. Gunn doesn&amp;rsquo;t just edge into adult territory with his violence, he embraces the R rating that Marvel would never give him, allowing limbs to be ripped from bodies and fates of his characters to usually come with a gross, sticky sound. It&amp;rsquo;s a film that&amp;rsquo;s playful in its action in ways that most modern blockbusters aren&amp;rsquo;t allowed to be. You can tell that Gunn and his team are having a blast, and that kind of thing can be infectious. Audiences know when a filmmaker is going through the motions for a corporation. The films that last are when that doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen, and Gunn is doing this from his Troma-raised passionate heart.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;rsquo;s also really an underrated filmmaker when it comes to managing comedic tone with his cast. The &amp;ldquo;Guardians&amp;rdquo; films felt fresh because they remembered things like charisma and playfulness, both of which are in abundance here too. Robbie knows Quinn inside and out by this point, and it feels like Gunn returns her a bit more to her origins (even just in color palette) than Ayer. Elba finally gets a strong action movie lead and nails it&amp;mdash;the conversation about how he&amp;rsquo;d still be an excellent James Bond should start again. He&amp;rsquo;s charismatic and even finds a little depth in his character&amp;rsquo;s conflict over being forced into heroism. They&amp;rsquo;re the standouts, but everyone here works, bringing their own joy to the party, which is a testament to Gunn&amp;rsquo;s skill with large ensembles. Like so many modern superhero movies, &amp;ldquo;The Suicide Squad&amp;rdquo; starts to feel long and repetitious after a while, and it&amp;rsquo;s a little disappointing that a film borne from a subversive template culminates in heroes and villains crashing into crumbling buildings again. Without spoiling anything, there&amp;rsquo;s an element of the final scenes of &amp;ldquo;The Suicide Squad&amp;rdquo; that I found playfully wonderful, but they also become overly familiar in their &amp;ldquo;big boom, building fall down&amp;rdquo; structure. As cleverly made as the film is, a lack of ambition seeps in during the final third. However, Gunn does get a grip on it just before it feels like it&amp;rsquo;s about to spin out of control back into blandness, centering it again on what has always interested him most of all: the underdog. It could be The Toxic Avenger, Rocket Raccoon, or The Polka-Dot Man&amp;mdash;they&amp;rsquo;re all the same to James Gunn, people who could be heroes if only given the chance.&lt;/p&gt;', 'img/upload/michaeladel1992@gmail.com/48ea48f6d2db2d4be62ab56d461fe748.jpg', '2021', 20, 29, '2021/11/01', '{\"like\":1,\"dislike\":0,\"memberLike\":[29],\"memberDislike\":[]}', 2, 2, 29),

So the jump from the sentient statues and relics of the Night at the Museum franchise to the virtual carnage of an ultra-violent video game in Free Guy is not as much of a stretch as it might at first seem. In this case it&amp;rsquo;s a non-playable character, or NPC, that is jolted out of its background role as cannon fodder for pre-teen gamers. Unaware that he&amp;rsquo;s in a game, bank teller Guy (a wide-eyed and adorable Ryan Reynolds) is content with his daily ritual of coffee, banter with best friend Buddy (Lil Rel Howery) and upwards of five separate armed raids on his place of work, until he sees Molotov Girl, the online avatar of Millie (Jodie Comer, hitting the sweet spot between unapproachable cool and utterly beguiling). Having crossed the rubicon that prevents the normals from talking to the &amp;ldquo;sunglasses people&amp;rdquo;, or players&amp;rsquo; avatars, Guy starts to learn the rules of the game he didn&amp;rsquo;t know he was part of. A combination of puppyish devotion to Millie (who has her own reasons for doggedly returning each day) and inherent decency means that he&amp;rsquo;s unexpectedly good at it. Tweens and teens will embrace the pinballing energy, the gamer-vlogger cameos and the fact that there are more Easter eggs than Cadbury World. But the film&amp;rsquo;s reach is considerably wider. There are thematic parallels with everything from The Lego Movie to The Matrix, but key to its appeal is an unabashed sweetness and goofy enthusiasm that proves irresistible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fq0-2tT8aFQ&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt; background-color: #f1c40f;&quot;&gt;&amp;hellip; we have a small favour to ask.

But Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings does so, and more. Director Destin Daniel Cretton, who co-wrote with Dave Callaham and Andrew Lanham, is canny enough to realise that the key to success with an effects-driven, eye-popping extravaganza is not the CGI spectacle, it&amp;rsquo;s the basic stuff. Textured characters. Karaoke and shots-fuelled friendships. And electrifyingly badass fight choreography. In the goofy exchanges between Simu Liu&amp;rsquo;s Shaun (heir to his father&amp;rsquo;s tricky relationship with power, and his mother&amp;rsquo;s fierce empathy) and his best friend, defender, drinking buddy and fellow valet car-parker Katy (Awkwafina), the film is already one of the freshest Marvel pictures in a long time. And that&amp;rsquo;s before the fight on a runaway bus featuring an eastern European man mountain with a laser arm prosthesis. But perhaps what&amp;rsquo;s more telling than where this film fits within the Marvel universe (it&amp;rsquo;s an outlier, and all the better for it) is how elegantly it slots into the wuxia fantasy-infused Chinese martial arts tradition. Both in casting (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&amp;rsquo;s Michelle Yeoh, as serene and deadly as ever, and Hero&amp;rsquo;s Tony Leung take key roles) and in set pieces (there&amp;rsquo;s a nod to the iconic bamboo forest sequence in House of Flying Daggers), the film takes its cues from the martial arts epics of the early 2000s. Paying homage without becoming derivative is a difficult balance, but the film succeeds. Likewise, Cretton negotiates potential cliches such as flashback sequences and that hoariest of old chestnuts, the training montage, with a gravity-defying lightness of touch. It&amp;rsquo;s only at the very end, when the picture trades its focus on exquisite, thrillingly executed fight sequences for a battle between a bunch of special effects, that this exhilarating blend of genres loses a bit of its shine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/1OXoDUtnyCQ&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;', 'img/upload/michaeladel1992@gmail.com/c61c85a6a99dbd3a8e26aebfba57f853.jpg', '2021', 36, 29, '2021/11/01', '{\"like\":0,\"dislike\":0,\"memberLike\":[],\"memberDislike\":[]}', 1, 2, 29),

But would these surprises be .... new ways of coming to terms with the unchangeable disaster? Unexpected coping strategies? Novel means of simply accepting the Avengers&amp;rsquo; stunningly permanent defeat? Or could it be &amp;hellip; something else? Paul Rudd, who plays Ant-Man, was challenged on TV about the possibility of his character shrinking to a tiny size, flying into some convenient orifice of the evil Thanos, and then grossly enlarging himself to make the great villain go splat like Mr Creosote. Rudd declined to be drawn. Well, I won&amp;rsquo;t disclose how things progress here, other than to say it allows the main players to revisit some of the scenes of their most spectacular franchise triumphs. And I have to admit, in all its surreal grandiosity, in all its delirious absurdity, there is a huge sugar rush of excitement to this mighty finale, finally interchanging with euphoric emotion and allowing us to say poignant farewells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;In chess, an &amp;ldquo;endgame&amp;rdquo; sees relatively few pieces on the board &amp;ndash; but of course, this film is much more heavily populated. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) is floating, desolately, in space, staring extinction in the face. Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) confronts the loss of his family &amp;ndash; a rather eerie, challengingly downbeat opening scene. Steve Rogers, formerly Captain America (Chris Evans) is helping others deal with their awful sense of cosmic grief. Rhodey (Don Cheadle) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) are grimly getting on things. Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) is a vivid new presence in everyone&amp;rsquo;s lives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34db2ce471f2b42959d4ed8fbc795e461d7bcd61/178_0_1799_1080/master/1799.jpg?width=445&amp;amp;quality=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;dpr=2&amp;amp;s=3fc26719aab77a15a12f190600fa5d57&quot; alt=&quot;Karen Gillan as Nebula in Avengers: Endgame.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;And change is the keynote. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) has found a way to co-exist as a gentle human intellectual and a green monster. He is now half-man, half-hulk (mulk?) and is now reconciled to a new twilight of celebrity, accepting selfie opportunities with kids. But Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is a worry. The great catastrophe has caused him to retreat to New Asgard, where he has put on an enormous amount of weight and morosely obsessed with beer and video games. It is a very funny performance from Hemsworth, emphasising that he is first among equals with the Avengers when it comes to comedy. Other people get funny lines as well, and the words &amp;ldquo;Mungo Jerry&amp;rdquo; gets one of the biggest laughs of the film.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;But part of this movie is about how Thor comes to terms with the memory of his mother, Frigga (Rene Russo), and also in fact how Tony Stark achieves closure on the subject of his dad, Howard (John Slattery). And there are many more characters and subordinate narrative arcs to absorb. The poster is not an infallible guide. It is, as ever, a huge intricately detailed and interlocking mosaic of figures within that strange Avengers universe, which uniquely (and bizarrely) combines both the mythic and the contemporary &amp;ndash; and which is here the stage for a Tolkienian quest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/TcMBFSGVi1c&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;314&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Avengers: Endgame is entirely preposterous and, yes, the central plot device here does not, in itself, deliver the shock of the new. But the sheer enjoyment and fun that it delivers, the pure exotic spectacle, are irresistible, as is its insouciant way of combining the serious and the comic. Without the comedy, the drama would not be palatable. Yet without the earnest, almost childlike belief in the seriousness of what is at stake, the funny stuff would not work either. As an artificial creation, the Avengers have been triumphant, and as entertainment, they have been unconquerable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;', 'img/upload/michaeladel1992@gmail.com/00c95ba5f10d75827c6f90d77d396637.jpg', '2019', 24, 29, '2021/11/01', '{\"like\":0,\"dislike\":0,\"memberLike\":[],\"memberDislike\":[]}', 2, 2, 29),

Yet watching the familiar elements (money, madness, women, swindling etc) I felt a certain empathy with Hall\'s sniffy reaction to the movie he saw &quot;decorating the Rialto screen&quot; all those years ago. Based on the self-aggrandising memoirs of convicted stock market trader Jordan Belfort, this three-hour orgy of greed, indulgence and swearing (more than 500 &quot;fucks&quot; &amp;ndash; a screen record for a drama) follows its antihero\'s over-powdered nose as he snorts his way from small-town fraudster to big-time crook. En route, he sets up the notorious Stratton Oakmont brokerage firm (the inspiration for the 2000 film Boiler Room), organises dwarf-throwing parties (the real-life Belfort denies that little people were ever thrown), consumes his own body weight in Quaaludes, blows coke up a hooker\'s butt and has a candle shoved up his own by someone called Venice. All this debauchery we view from the smugly narrated POV of the &quot;self-made man&quot; himself, while the victims of his &quot;pump and dump&quot; schemes, many of them ordinary working-class folk (&quot;postmen, always postmen&quot;), remain as absent from the screen as they were from Belfort\'s venal mind. Since opening to mixed reactions in the US (one cinema refused refunds to outraged patrons on the grounds that &quot;Mr Scorsese is an auteur and his work is rated brilliant by critics and academic bastions of thought&quot;), this exhausting movie has been charged with revelling in, rather than explicitly judging, the obscene lifestyle it depicts. Certainly, Belfort himself appears thrilled to have been portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio, who beat Brad Pitt to the lucrative book rights several years ago, rights from which Belfort insists: &quot;I am not making a single dime.&quot; Hmm. Yet having now seen the film twice, I can attest that it made me not love but utterly loathe Belfort &amp;ndash; a moral victory, perhaps, but also something of a problem, because a character who is simply detestable rapidly becomes uninteresting. While The Wolf of Wall Street slavishly apes the style and structure of Goodfellas, the dramatic magnetism that made Ray Liotta\'s Henry Hill so watchable is sorely absent. This is not a criticism of DiCaprio, whose full-throttle performance is both tightly nuanced and insanely OTT. Rather, it\'s a problem with the subject, whose reptilian repugnance and vacuum-sealed amorality Scorsese and screenwriter Terence Winter fail to crack. For all his motivational Gordon Gekko speeches and beamingly boisterous bonhomie, Belfort remains as impenetrably alienating as the human impersonator at the heart of Cronenberg\'s ice-cold Cosmopolis, a studiedly austere arthouse endeavour that was at least intentionally boring &amp;ndash; sort of. As for The Wolf of Wall Street, you wind up realising that there\'s a very good reason why no classic movie ever opened with the words: &quot;As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a stockbroker&amp;hellip; &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2014/1/17/1389973576664/LIBRARY-IMAGE-OF-THE-WOLF-001.jpg?width=445&amp;amp;quality=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;dpr=2&amp;amp;s=2b764ee0e3ca51d9c626818a5120ca96&quot; alt=&quot;LIBRARY IMAGE OF THE WOLF OF WALL STREET&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;It doesn\'t help that the bacchanalian scenes are conjured in tones that recall the naffest interludes of Kubrick\'s Eyes Wide Shut. For all its avowed &quot;adult&quot; aesthetic, there\'s something leeringly adolescent about the endless displays of pulchritudinous flesh, the orgies in particular looking like outtakes from some over-glossed 90s erotic thriller with auteurist affectations. Depressing, too, that while endless full-frontal nudity is required of the women, the only penis on display is fleeting, flaccid and comically fake. Belfort may be a chauvinist ass, but that\'s no reason for Scorsese to follow suit. With a couple of notable exceptions, the women here are all wives, girlfriends and sex-workers. In one momentarily moving third-act speech, Belfort tells us that fellow financier Kimmie Belzer was &quot;one of the first brokers here, one of Stratton\'s original 20&quot;. It\'s a revealing moment, so how come we\'ve barely glimpsed her until now? Another female co-worker only gets a look in when getting her head shaved at an office party, like some latter-day witch. Meanwhile, as the second Mrs Belfort, Margot Robbie sinks her teeth into a role that is more Sharon Stone than Lorraine Bracco, while Joanna Lumley makes the most of a somewhat thankless cameo as Belfort\'s British aunt-in-law, holding her own amid a lazily comic montage of Big Ben, double-decker buses and picturesque London parks. On a technical level &amp;ndash; and with characters as unlovable as these, technicalities are everything &amp;ndash; the film is as slick as its subject\'s sales patter, with cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto shooting on a hybrid of film and digital, shifting the depth and clarity of his lenses to match the focus and/or confusion of the character. Editor Thelma Schoonmaker has done a first-rate job helping a struggling Scorsese get the running time down to just under three hours, but I still found myself guiltily longing for Harvey &quot;Scissorhands&quot; Weinstein to burst in and commit some Gangs of New York-style butchery, leaving at least another 20 minutes bleeding on the floor. None of which is to say that The Wolf of Wall Street does not have its pleasures, notably Jonah Hill in versatile post-Moneyball form as Belfort\'s slimy sidekick Donnie Azoff, and a thin-faced, big-haired Matthew McConaughey teaching his protege about the financial importance of masturbation. But by the time the real Belfort gets a final-reel cameo, introducing his alter ego on stage as the now-reborn &quot;world\'s greatest sales trainer!&quot;, you can\'t help but wish that Joe Pesci had been on hand to ask them all if they thought he was funny. Now that would be amusing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;', 'img/upload/michaeladel1992@gmail.com/cf2811c39f49efa132cf94e35c12aec6.jpg', '2013', 34, 29, '2021/11/01', '{\"like\":2,\"dislike\":1,\"memberLike\":[42,40],\"memberDislike\":[29]}', 116, 2, 29),

Emma Stone&amp;rsquo;s Cruella de Vil is much more grounded and thus not as camp, a supervillain with a believable backstory &amp;ndash; born Estella, bullied by boys at school and established as a maverick who&amp;rsquo;s always refused to &amp;ldquo;follow the pattern&amp;rdquo; (as her single mother puts it) in both dressmaking and in life. Set in 1970s London against a backdrop of the emerging punk scene, this playful prequel by Craig Gillespie (I, Tonya) is a fine feat of world-building. Like Phantom Thread or Marie Antoinette, it&amp;rsquo;s also an excellent fashion film, playing on the myth of the egocentric, detail-oriented genius. One of its main narrative threads involves Estella&amp;rsquo;s apprenticeship at, and eventual sabotage of, a couture fashion house headed by an icy narcissist named The Baroness (Emma Thompson, exuding Meryl Streep&amp;rsquo;s energy in The Devil Wears Prada). Fashion enthusiasts may also draw connections between the House of Baroness&amp;rsquo;s sculptural, Dior-esque gowns and Estella&amp;rsquo;s Alexander McQueen-influenced lace and leather looks (McQueen, of course, succeeded John Galliano at Givenchy in the 90s when the latter moved to Dior). There is even a reference to McQueen&amp;rsquo;s 2011 monarch butterfly dress. The film is structured as a family-friendly heist movie that plays out against a series of costume balls. There&amp;rsquo;s probably one act too many and so the pacing suffers; younger children with shorter attention spans might, too. Still, Stone is a joy: vampy, sneering and as eager to please as a dalmatian.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 2; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZHRG5UuP3kw&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;314&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;', 'img/upload/michaeladel1992@gmail.com/bfb1eca66f804fecaea613eed59eac96.jpg', '2021', 22, 29, '2021/11/01', '{\"like\":1,\"dislike\":0,\"memberLike\":[29],\"memberDislike\":[]}', 2, 2, 29);

(37, 'series', 'game of thrones', '&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Game of Thrones started out erotic and ended ultraviolent. We met Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage) in a brothel, his hair Cobra Kai blond, his body attended upon by a thinkpiece of prostitutes. Our first sighting of Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) was right during bath time, just before her forced marriage to a musclebound barbarian whose butt would glisten in the firelight. Eight seasons later, the fantasy drama&amp;rsquo;s series finale united those two in cauterized catastrophe. Tyrion&amp;rsquo;s hair had long since darkened a prestigious shade of bummer. He walked through the King&amp;rsquo;s Landing napalmscape, noticing child-sized ash mounds, uncovering not one but two dead siblings from a pile of plot rubble. Meanwhile, Daenerys stood triumphant above a city-sized graveyard, celebrating the triumph of her will, her personal kill count suddenly large enough to make the all-consuming Night King look about as fatal as a single Sand Sister. The finale belonged to Tyrion and Dany, really. More so Tyrion, unfortunately, and Dany got a bit overshadowed by her dragon. Oh, the show paid fealty to the Stark siblings, handing out happy endings to all Ned&amp;rsquo;s remainder. Two Starks sat on two thrones in Westeros. Another Stark sailed west to discover America. And their protagonistic brother-cousin rode north with his hippie tribal pals, his smile warming the snowy forest. We all agree, he totally snubbed the Night&amp;rsquo;s Watch, right? And moved up north to start a wildling family? In hindsight, Jon (Kit Harington) only ever felt happy camping in the snowy wasteland. He earned himself a happy kind of punishment, hunting forever with best pal Tormund (Kristofer Hivju). No wonder Grey Worm (Jacob Anderson) looked so unhappy. His Queen got killed, and the culprit got a minimum-security vacation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TLHbTTshpL1M1lLVr3Tny2ipvfQ=/0x0:1200x763/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:1200x763):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16314531/pasted_image_0__6_.png&quot; alt=&quot;game of thrones season 8 dragon attack on king&amp;rsquo;s landing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Game of Thrones loved the Starks in the end &amp;mdash; a bit of a twist, really, since it couldn&amp;rsquo;t always figure out what to do with them. Bran (Isaac Hempstead Wright) spent long years hiking north, before returning to Winterfell with his emotion chip removed. Arya (Maisie Williams) sold her cockles &amp;mdash; &amp;ldquo;Oysters, clams, and cockles!!!&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; on a semester abroad where she learned a very awesome shape-changing power the final season forgot about. Sansa (Sophie Turner) followed Dany into forced marriage &amp;mdash; a miserable wound the series would try healing by promoting her into a Very Important Administrative Role that also pushed her to the narrative sidelines. Being cruel to be kind here: There was always at least one thing wrong with Game of Thrones. Jaime (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) went to Dorne. Brienne (Gwendolyn Christie) spent a season staring patiently at a window. There was that time when Dany&amp;rsquo;s whole thing was &amp;ldquo;My dragons!&amp;rdquo; and I think you had to really love pyramids to ever fully groove on her days in Meereen. Nobody could ever make the Red God happen. Season 7 reunited Arya and Sansa, by then two of the most famous TV characters of the decade&amp;hellip; and teased a goofy fake-out about maybe one of them killing the other. In season 8, Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey), the longtime antagonist whose whole Disney Princess Plotting Incest Homicide Coups iconography practically invented this series, got to dispassionately bang a pirate Viking before staring patiently out a window. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KRJxz6_DCU125AEtLmHmDilSRn0=/0x0:3156x2100/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:3156x2100):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16314554/a46442da38a11a9893af782c33409a8b6bd3dffc3053eb9ff5d34b63eaf484f345d7a08be52d1e43bf9c3f114ec3a08a.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;game of thrones arya and walder frey&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;And then she died in her lover&amp;rsquo;s arms, reads her plot summary, an oddly clich&amp;eacute;d ending for a character who was anything but. And none of this mattered when the show was really going: when Thrones hit its stride in its relentless third and fourth seasons, or when it threw its whole narrative chessboard out the window next to poor Tommen at the end of season 6. Actually, the imperfections of Thrones deepened the fandom, I think. You could play the game of thrones along at home, rooting for certain characters and families, preferring one ongoing story arc over another. The source material was literary and the drama&amp;rsquo;s intentions were epic, but its success reflected the instincts of reality TV, a competition culture that inspires engagement toward an endgame: the final Rose Ceremony, the Head of Household competition, whoever will finally sit upon the Iron Throne. (This is why Game of Thrones was especially beloved by people who think art should be enjoyed like sports.) There are annoying people on every season of reality television, human beings whose mere presence on camera can feel like an assault on good taste. But you learn to laugh about it, like most viewers learned to laugh whenever a journey on Game of Thrones took a whole season, like those same viewers learned to laugh again when the continent shrunk in season 7 and everyone started teleporting between cities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt; I preferred Game of Thrones in its middle ages, I guess, when it was still cheap enough to require a sense of humor. That was the magical golden era when King&amp;rsquo;s Landing was filled with colorful personalities, Lannisters and Tyrells, phony Baratheons and randy Dornishmen. All the bitchfaced backstabbery therein crosscut into the more recognizably epic-fantasy antics of Jon and Dany, battling barbarians and monsters in extreme climates. This was some heretofore unimagined nexus point for people who loved Dark Souls and people who loved Gossip Girl, and the contrast had a purpose. You could watch Game of Thrones and conclude two things: The obvious heroes were awesome, and the obvious heroes were idiots. Politics was everything, because real power depended on which Lannister made better allies &amp;mdash; or politics was nothing, and all the florid dialogue scenes between smart characters would soon enough fall under blue zombie people and dragons. Whereas this final season was all about big-huge set pieces, and a lot of the complexity burned away. I don&amp;rsquo;t think anyone can be happy that this season focused, in the end, on Jon Snow, the least complicated main character on an ensemble full of brutal instincts and grasping ambition. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ve always tried to do the right thing,&amp;rdquo; Tyrion told Jon, in a scene that also featured the line &amp;ldquo;Love is more powerful than reason,&amp;rdquo; yeesh. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WDCjrGZveru-vRY9nUnMho4NEfw=/0x0:1400x700/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:1400x700):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16314560/daenerys_horse_heart_game_of_thrones1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;daenerys eating heart game of thrones season 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Jon became, briefly, a proxy husk besieged by two bigger personalities. In one corner: his queen, his lover. &amp;ldquo;Build the new world with me,&amp;rdquo; she asked him. In the other corner: Jon&amp;rsquo;s pal Tyrion, whose oratory would be powerful enough to singlehandedly transform Westeros into an elective monarchy. Jon killed Dany, and then her dragon incinerated the Iron Throne. Both actions look a bit inexplicable to me. Credit Clarke for playing her final scene with an unreadable, unblinking confidence. The finale tried to explain her turn into mass homicide, by which I mean Tyrion literally explained it to Jon. It sure sounded like she was talking about conquering the world, which isn&amp;rsquo;t really a thing she&amp;rsquo;s ever expressed an interest in. Was Dany psychotic? Was she acting out a particularly violent strategy for eventual peace? Even her two scenes in the finale felt whiplashed, from imperial kill-the-bastards fascism to lovesick adoration. I appreciate the confusion, though I&amp;rsquo;m still left feeling like Thrones lost track of Dany in its final phase. Whereas Drogon&amp;rsquo;s destruction of the mega-stabby swordchair is very on-the-nose &amp;mdash; and very funny, if you accept that a dragon can have serious ideological problems with the monarchic system of governance. It was a big moment, the kind of hashtaggy mini-event Thrones tried to create often in its last few years. That urge could leave some characters in the lurch, though, sacrificing drama at the altar of coolness. The single most maddening sequence in the entire run of Game of Thrones came in the penultimate episode, when two giant man-hulks met on a stairwell for their final eye-gouging punchfight &amp;mdash; and Queen Cersei Lannister, First of Her Name, had to quietly skitter past them. Was that scene supposed to be funny? It felt reductive, no matter what, all her great plans dissolving away from a climactic bro-down. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t a great finale, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t think it was terrible. &amp;ldquo;Middling&amp;rdquo; sounds right: It left you with a lot to think about, even if most of those thoughts jockeyed between &amp;ldquo;Bwaahhhh??&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Huh.&amp;rdquo; The most intriguing scene came after the epic moments were done, when the remaining lords and ladies of Westeros assembled to figure out what the hell to do with this country of theirs. There was a very funny cameo by Tobias Menzies as Edmure Tully, whose brief moment of gasbaggery also reminded you how funny this show could be about preening egomaniacs who believe in their own self-righteousness, before it became all about badasses doing war stuff. And yet this sudden return to political realities after all the shaky-cam warfare felt a bit like parliamentary bumper bowling, like no idea could be a bad one by virtue of finalehood. A few years ago, every halfway powerful lord of Westeros used a tiny rumor of succession fraud as an opportunity to declare revolution. In this finale, the Dany-allied Iron Islands and the grinning new Prince of Dorne nodded along while an imprisoned Lannister suggested making the least famous Stark the new King of Westeros. It&amp;rsquo;s because, Tyrion explained, Brandon the Broken has the best story. Didn&amp;rsquo;t Arya just become famous for killing the walking personification of death? You&amp;rsquo;re telling me that tracks lower for the average illiterate Westerosi than some kid who survived a bad fall before swallowing Ancestry.com? Worth remembering, I think, when Game of Thrones was at its best. That would be season 4, the phase when every corner of the opening-credits map hit runaway-train momentum. Every new character still felt immediately essential: Hello, Oberyn (Pedro Pascal), you sure seem fun! And there was the whole perfect little show-within-a-show where Arya and the Hound (Rory McCann) wandered from one dead end to another. George R. R. Martin&amp;rsquo;s source novels, comprising the yet-unfinished A Song of Ice and Fire series, are brilliant and idiosyncratic. In Martin&amp;rsquo;s telling, the wars of Westeros flip between up-close perspectives, a shifting POV narrative roughly TV-equivalent to the focal-episode style of Lost or The Leftovers. The series that showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss extrapolated from those novels was never so inventive stylistically.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hjs2RJxkKUm4JheE5VGNsMrmtMM=/0x0:1417x789/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:1417x789):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16314601/Screen_Shot_2019_06_02_at_11.07.28_AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;theon tortured season 3 game of thrones&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt; It visibly suffered when it ran out of story to adapt &amp;mdash; and some of their changes could feel a bit dull, like keeping Theon (Alfie Allen) on screen for two straight seasons of relentless torture. But credit Benioff and Weiss as producers. They cast child actors who grew into compelling adults, especially Turner and Williams. That decision alone gave Thrones added potency as it went along. If you were born at the right moment, you followed the Harry Potter heroes from prepubescence into British drinking age, and then tagged along with the Thrones kids from their teenage wasteland into twentysomething political prominence. And Benioff and Weiss seemed willing to make a little room for pleasant surprises, like Bella Ramsey&amp;rsquo;s Lyanna Mormont, a scene-stealer who slayed a giant. Game of Thrones will be remembered for its ornate decade-long narrative &amp;mdash; and yet the best flourishes I&amp;rsquo;ll associate with Benioff and Weiss feel impulsive, even self-immolating. They initially tried to adapt the books&amp;rsquo; version of Euron Greyjoy, a looming pantheistic menace. And then they seemed to just throw up their hands and let actor Pilou Asb&amp;aelig;k have some fun, making Euron the last person in Westeros who seemed remotely happy to be here. I love all the source novels, which I guess is one of many possible biases you could have against Game of Thrones. But Benioff and Weiss could be compelling adaptors. They built up the animosity between Littlefinger (Aiden Gillen) and Varys (Conleith Hill) in vibrant conversations not really present in the books &amp;mdash; though that thread dropped away as both characters started blabbing their way toward avoidable executions. And in Martin&amp;rsquo;s telling, Robb Stark is a well-meaning zero viewed distantly &amp;mdash; but the writers gave Richard Madden a little more to do, romantic material that turned the character&amp;rsquo;s exit truly despondent. Left to their own devices, they eventually gave in in to some of the worst instincts of fan fiction, like that time they threw a bunch of characters together for a dull trip beyond the wall to pick up a zombie corpse. I believe strongly that the best instinct of the books and the series was the urge to subvert your narrative expectations &amp;mdash; but by the time the show staged #CleganeBowl as a showdown out of a Mortal Kombat movie, it felt like Twitter&amp;rsquo;s trending topics deserved a co-writing credit. Am I being too mean? Am I being too nice? It&amp;rsquo;s hard for me, in the shadow of the series finale, to conjure up much ice or fire for the vast expanse of Game of Thrones. It had its ups, its downs, its transcendent moments, its miserable phases: a lot to take in, or an unusual definition of &amp;ldquo;okay.&amp;rdquo; The show was beloved enough to be criticized by everyone for something, and unique enough to create a whole new shared cultural language. It had some very good seasons and then a couple of indifferent seasons leading up to an ending that felt more dutiful than inspired. It became a generational phenomenon, uniting viewers in a shared symbolic perspective of the world. You didn&amp;rsquo;t have to squint to see the Army of the Dead as a symbol of climate change, though specifically the kind of climate change you could kill with a cool battle scene. And the gradual global rise of Dany and the Stark children fed, I think, into a particularly millennial feeling of ascension, of young people rising up to change the world. Every possibly -ismatic framework has been glued onto Game of Thrones, a whole symbiotic lit-pile of deep readings into the gender politics, the racial stereotyping, the portrait of liberation philosophy edging into fascism, its portrait of religious zealotry. All great fun to read, and I don&amp;rsquo;t think any TV series about killing a dragon with a giant crossbow can fully sustain this kind of analysis. And then Thrones did itself no favors by deciding that, like, the solution to every complex statecraft problem was to let the Starks handle everything. This final season wanted to tell two stories: a final showdown with the Army of the Dead, and then a final showdown between two queens. Agree to disagree, maybe, on the variable excitement of fighting zombies in near-total darkness. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t muster much emotion for the Battle of Winterfell, and its mere existence felt like the last gasp of Hardcore Gritty fantasy, a muddy brand of poorly lit &amp;ldquo;realism&amp;rdquo; that looks a bit lame and played-out in the ecstatic age of Thor: Ragnarok. As for those queens&amp;hellip; well, Cersei didn&amp;rsquo;t have anything to do this season, which strikes me as the one complete failure of imagination. The final two episodes of Game of Thrones gave plenty of real estate to, like, Tyrion&amp;rsquo;s love for his brother Jaime, or Tyrion&amp;rsquo;s fraternal bond with Jon. Anyone approaching Game of Thrones from a gender-studies perspective would have a field day with this finale. The last words Tyrion said to Jon were about pissing of the edge of the world, a &amp;ldquo;callback&amp;rdquo; that sounded like an invitation to cross some streams. And the last properly heard spoken conversation ever in Game of Thrones was a joke about a brothel! The broseph mentality shined through in this last season, all the more obvious after a couple years that strove hard to build the female characters into major roles. Tyrion could cry majestically over his fallen brother, but Dany would react to Missandei&amp;rsquo;s death with a cuckoo makeup job. This last season couldn&amp;rsquo;t get Arya and Cersei into the same room &amp;mdash; but it had time for Euron and Jaime to fight over Cersei, or for Tyrion to bond with Jon over how much they both loved the ker-azy gal they had to kill. I wonder if Benioff and Weiss wrote themselves into a corner. Season 6 of Thrones ended with a killer one-two punch, the thrilling Battle of the Bastards that ended Ramsay Bolton (Iwan Rheon) and the even-more-thrilling finale which exploded the High Sparrow (Jonathan Pryce) and a whole Tyrell generation. At the time, this felt like a statement of purpose, a decisive step forward from the source material. It was also a bit of schadenfreude: Ramsay and the High Sparrow had spent their time on the show physically or emotionally torturing key characters, and it was a kick to see them receive comeuppance via canine or explosion. In hindsight, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure Thrones really had that many moves left. As Queen, Cersei&amp;rsquo;s big story line was pregnancy, a sacred last-ditch subplot for any long-running series out of ideas for female characters. Jon and Dany fell in love, but there was a basic lack of chemistry there. Everyone had to get a zombie corpse to convince Cersei to help, and then Cersei just didn&amp;rsquo;t help, because why on earth would she? It all just started to feel small, really, like Westeros was precisely as large as the Starks and their pals. Jaime hooked up with Brienne, which was just a bad idea &amp;mdash; another reductive twist, suggesting that &amp;ldquo;emotionally complicated professional respect&amp;rdquo; was too complicated for the show to maintain. Missandei (Nathalie Emmanuel) got killed, and that drove Daenerys to some kind of madness, and yet it was hard to remember the last time the two characters even spoke to each other. Missandei got lost in the shuffle, like a lot of the non-royal characters. There were more buildings to explode, I guess. And then Thrones could just get a little repetitive. At the end of season 4, Arya set out for unknown shores, devastation behind her in the ruined Westeros, new adventures illuminating her horizon ahead. It was an optimistic vision of hard-won grace &amp;mdash; not even triumph, Arya Stark would never properly experience that, but something like hope. Season 8 ended on a similar note. Arya was setting out west this time, fulfilling an ambition to explore off the map. Her sorta-brother Jon was on a similar journey, going north to begin a new kind of watch with the newly chill wildlings. But then Sansa took up residence on a new throne in Winterfell, while Bran launched a somewhat absentee reign as the King of Westeros. Certain logical questions come to mind: Why is there still a Night&amp;rsquo;s Watch? Why are the wildlings going back to live in punishing glacier country? Did they really rebuild the Red Keep that quickly? But I&amp;rsquo;m struck by the fact that &amp;mdash; even right here at the end &amp;mdash; Game of Thrones let you have it both ways. The Starks left Westeros, the Starks stayed in Westeros. Choose your own adventure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;', 'img/upload/michaeladel1992@gmail.com/5414b3e48e6c9d013c0fbfffa2018f03.jpg', '2011', 35, 29, '2021/11/01', '{\"like\":3,\"dislike\":0,\"memberLike\":[42,45,29],\"memberDislike\":[]}', 8, 2, 29),

There&amp;rsquo;s no shortage of zombie extras on The Walking Dead, and the show never hesitates to push for larger groups and bigger action sequences so long as the budget holds up. There&amp;rsquo;s no denying that, even with CGI sweetening, &amp;ldquo;For Blood&amp;rdquo; has a lot of zombie moving parts, and a lot of relatively complicated action sequences involving multiple parties fighting side by side, against one another, against the dead, or some combination of all three.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18.6667px;&quot;&gt;A lot of that has to be due to experience. By the time of any series&amp;rsquo; eleventh season, the cast, crew, and extras should be used to working together, even with the inevitable comings and goings of new faces. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot to be said for continuity, and there&amp;rsquo;s a lot to be said for having people who know the deal, know how to hit their marks, and know not to walk into the path of exploding flash pots and black powder bombs. When you know what you&amp;rsquo;re doing, it&amp;rsquo;s easier to do more complex tasks. And, when you know what you&amp;rsquo;re doing, it&amp;rsquo;s a lot easier to use your best tricks against your unwitting enemy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18.6667px;&quot;&gt; One of the smartest things in &amp;ldquo;For Blood&amp;rdquo; is the fact that, when faced with a new opponent, Negan and Maggie are smart enough to use a trick Negan picked up from his time with the Whisperers as a weapon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18.6667px;&quot;&gt; It worked against them, right? Why wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it work to allow a very small group of people to get into Meridian? Why wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be used as an effective force multiplier like how the Governor used it at the Prison, or Carol used it at Terminus, or Alpha during her many attacks on Alexandria? Certainly, it&amp;rsquo;s a phenomenon that everyone knows about; herds have been a thing in the past and will be a thing going forward, but rarely does someone use the herd as cover for a full-fledged assault mission. At least, it&amp;rsquo;s new to the Reapers, and Daryl isn&amp;rsquo;t going to spill the beans. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to come up with new ideas in a show that&amp;rsquo;s been on eleven seasons. We&amp;rsquo;ve seen all sorts of tricks, but we have yet to see medieval Korean weaponry come into play. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18.6667px;&quot;&gt;Between the hwacha that the Reapers deploy as their ultimate zombie-killing weapon (even more so than land mines and also useful if you have to fight 16th century Japanese invaders), Rosita&amp;rsquo;s macuahuitl, and a few kukris, the prop department has done a wonderful job of digging into the history of weapons to find new armaments to use on zombies. Old fashioned, yes, but no less terrifying when Pope orders it aimed into the courtyard to kill everyone within its range with fireworks-powered arrows, be they walkers, Maggie&amp;rsquo;s assault team, or his fellow Reapers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18.6667px;&quot;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s desperation, driven by intense paranoia. Since his introduction, Pope&amp;rsquo;s blend of personal charisma and religious fervor has kept Daryl, the outsider, on edge. His own Reapers were willing to turn a blind eye to it, as it seems to have developed gradually over time, but Daryl and the audience are able to see past personal loyalty and see the dangerous person Pope is, made all the more so by Ritchie Coster&amp;rsquo;s sweaty, physical performance. He&amp;rsquo;s outwardly confident, but the panic is clear on his features as the growing mob of zombies outside his gates get closer, because he&amp;rsquo;s certain that somehow Maggie is behind this. She is, but that&amp;rsquo;s no excuse for turning weapons on your own people and committing the ultimate betrayal in the eyes of Leah. Eric Mountain&amp;rsquo;s script puts the point home repeatedly; family first, over everything else. If you&amp;rsquo;re willing to let your family die for nothing, and willing to sacrifice members of your family like pawns in a game against your own obsession, then you&amp;rsquo;re too far gone to be saved. But if you cross family, then you&amp;rsquo;re an enemy, even if you&amp;rsquo;re the love of someone&amp;rsquo;s life. Leah might not be able to forgive Daryl for what he&amp;rsquo;s done, but she at least gives him the same opportunity the stranger gathering food for his sick wife had. Daryl gets to run. There just might not be anywhere to run to if Rosita, Carol, Aaron, and the rest of the people in Alexandria can&amp;rsquo;t repair the walls, stop the fire in the windmill, and fight off the walkers that have broken through the defenses during a gale-force thunderstorm. Daryl&amp;rsquo;s situation and the situation in Alexandria are well-crafted mirrors of one another.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18.6667px;&quot;&gt; Daryl tries multiple things to get away from The Reapers and warn his friends, and all of them fail. The Alexandria crew undertake multiple missions to preserve their town, but nothing seems to go right for them either. There&amp;rsquo;s another breach of the walls, walkers swarm the safe house, and the survivors are forced to abandon the bottom floor of the house to the dead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18.6667px;&quot;&gt; (As if that wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough, the basement where Gracie and Judith hide is also flooding.) Director Sharat Raju does a great job of amplifying the tension and anxiety present in Mountain&amp;rsquo;s script. The trapped survivors in Alexandria echo the original trapped survivors in Night of the Living Dead. Pope&amp;rsquo;s instability grows with every interaction with Norman Reedus&amp;rsquo;s Daryl (who has some solid character moments this week) and Lynn Collins&amp;rsquo;s Leah (likewise). Reedus and Collins really play well off one another, without it being too obvious how things will play out for either character, or for the rest of the Reapers. Both stories work well, and there&amp;rsquo;s no real break in the tension between the two. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18.6667px;&quot;&gt;Both only turn the tension up leading to the season-pausing cliffhanger.

A Tolkienesque vibe suffuses the air, elves and dwarves are scattered with a lavish hand, and every character has 20% too many vowels or too few consonants in their name. Based on the books by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski (and also known to fans of the popular video games based on the same stories), the eight-part series tells the effects-heavy tale of Geralt of Rivia, one of a rare breed of monster-hunters known as Witchers. These are mutated supernatural beings who roam the pseudo-medieval land divining the locations of monsters&amp;rsquo; lairs and using their special powers to slay the variously fell beasts. Geralt&amp;rsquo;s first is a tremendously horrible giant spider thing for which I was not at all prepared. Fortunately, Geralt is played by Henry Cavill, a juttingsome chin attached to a man and quite the largest actor working at the moment, so the contest is soon over. Geralt, poor misfortunate if excellently built Witcher that he is, becomes embroiled in a conflict between two bellicose human nations, Nilfgaardian Empire and Northern Kingdoms. I refer you back to Miss Jean Brodie at this point. His adventures begin when Lars Mikkelsen as Stregobor, mage and overseer of a prelapsarian garden full of naked people, commissions him to kill the princess Renfri. According to Streggy-boy, who is rapidly taking on the aura of a medieval incel, she is one of 60 girls accursed and dangerously mutated by an eclipse. The 4chan mage has had many of them killed and autopsied to prove his theory. Renfri&amp;rsquo;s mutation renders her immune to his magical powers, in case you were wondering why he doesn&amp;rsquo;t assassinate her himself. It is also possible that irenic landscapes do not take care of themselves and he is kept busy maintaining the espaliered fruit trees between internet rants. Either way, he wants Geralt to end her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ndl1W4ltcmg&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;314&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;But Geralt is woke as well as large, and does not warm to Streggy&amp;rsquo;s toxic masculinity. &amp;ldquo;Evil is evil,&amp;rdquo; he informs his potential employer with an integrity this freelancer can only admire. &amp;ldquo;Greater, lesser, middling. It&amp;rsquo;s all the same.&amp;rdquo; That sound you hear is a thousand monkeys falling off their typing stools in exhaustion. As it&amp;rsquo;s only the first episode, one cannot think this augurs well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;There are attempts at knowingness: at one point, our Henry tells someone a prophecy has to rhyme. This is not a good idea, as it throws into too sharp relief the limits to what Geralt and his merry band of sorceresses and proto-feminist princesses can be said to know. Play it straight, dear scriptwriters, or don&amp;rsquo;t play it at all. My own pledge, made when The Witcher and I had to part company, is that I shall from hereon dedicate myself to becoming rich and powerful enough to commission my own epic swords&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;sorcerers fantasy in which everyone has a short back and sides. I can&amp;rsquo;t bear any longer the sight of actors strolling around in aesthetically displeasing stringy wigs, which are surely the height of impracticability for any warrior, supernatural or otherwise, and make everyone look like a sub-Fabio who managed a term at Lamda before dropping out in unspecified disgrace. That is my Christmas wish. But again, if you like this sort of thing, go nuts. And a happy festive season to you all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;', 'img/upload/admin@admin.com/b7eedd1f02d14dec200afcd83f5704ef.jpg', '2019', 35, 42, '2021/11/02', '{\"like\":4,\"dislike\":0,\"memberLike\":[42,29,45,8],\"memberDislike\":[]}', 7, 2, NULL),

It&amp;rsquo;s a simple concept for a show with the potential for endless possibilities&amp;mdash;there is so much supernatural lore to explore, and there&amp;rsquo;s definitely a market for it. Throw two unfathomably attractive leads into the mix and you&amp;rsquo;ve got yourself a winner, which is evident from the fact that it has been running for 15 seasons straight. In fact, Supernatural only just wrapped last Thursday, with the series finale leaving fans feeling bittersweet (more on that later). The show began in 2005 and has garnered a considerable and loyal fan base since then (myself included). Personally, I&amp;rsquo;ve been aware of the show for a mighty long time&amp;mdash;in fact, I&amp;rsquo;ve started the show many times over the course of its run, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never managed to get any further than season two&amp;hellip; until now. Five months ago, while looking for a new show to ruin my life with, I decided to finish what I&amp;rsquo;d started all those years ago. It was settled&amp;mdash;I was going to commit to the long run. Did I come to regret that decision? Well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/supernatural-series-finale-review-carry-on.jpg?resize=768%2C432&quot; alt=&quot;Sam and Dean in the Supernatural Series Finale&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Obviously, I knew what to expect going into this&amp;mdash;after all, I&amp;rsquo;d seen the first two seasons (though it had been a few years) and I&amp;rsquo;d heard my fair share of spoilers from exasperated friends and Tumblr and Reddit users alike. I was also familiar with Jared Padalecki from his roles as white boy of the month Trey Lipton in the Mary-Kate and Ashley movie New York Minute (2005), and Dean Forester in Gilmore Girls (2000). That said, nothing could have prepared me for this show in its entirety. I laughed, I cried, I cringed, and I swooned. Today, I&amp;rsquo;m going to explore whether or not it was all worth it. PS: Some spoilers ahead. If you&amp;rsquo;ve already seen the show, disregard this message. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t, disregard it anyway because with the rate that characters on this show die and come back to life, nothing is really a spoiler. Plus, there are 15 seasons to get through&amp;mdash;trust me when I say you&amp;rsquo;ll forget anyway.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/X87rY9LZkhs&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;314&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;The pilot episode starts with a flashback: Mary Winchester, mother to Sam and Dean, dies in a suspicious fire. Looking to avenge his wife&amp;rsquo;s death, John Winchester (father to Sam and Dean) dedicates his life to hunting monsters. He raises the two brothers to become proficient hunters: Dean (the eldest) falls in line with ease because he&amp;rsquo;s a massive daddy&amp;rsquo;s boy, while baby Sam grows to resent his borderline-abusive father because he wants a normal life. Sam abandons the &amp;lsquo;family business&amp;rsquo; as soon as he&amp;rsquo;s independent and eventually pursues law at Stanford University. Twenty-two years on, he&amp;rsquo;s living with his beautiful girlfriend, aceing school, and barely speaking to his brother, which brings us to the start of the series. Daddy dearest goes missing while out hunting. Worried, Dean pays Sam a visit at his dorm and convinces him to help search for their father. Sam is initially reluctant to follow Dean, but soon relents and the pair head off on their first hunt. A bro-bonding sesh, a Pontianak and a few witty quips later, Sam returns to his dorm to find that his girlfriend Jessica has been murdered in the exact supernatural manner as his mother (bummer). This full-circle moment then leads him to return to the hunting life. Cue: The rest of the show.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;For fifteen years, two brothers with a historically cursed name have traveled the country in a cherry 1967 Chevy Impala, taking down baddies and saving the innocent, all on a quest to find out where their father went on a hunting trip, or to stop the demon Azazel, or stop the Apocalypse, avoid destiny, confront the Darkness, and deny God himself. The thing is, a show that started out as a monster-of-the week quickly revved up into an all encompassing story that entertained, terrified, and had heavy themes on family and self identity as it was about eviscerating creatures from the beyond. The previous episode saw the true ending of the season &amp;mdash; Chuck had been defeated, Jack was promoted to deity status to put things right and the world in a sense began turning as usual again. What we have here in the true series finale is a wrap up on the fifteen years preceding that. This episode should be looked as as an epilogue, with enough references to keep longtime fans laughing at all the inside jokes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;The beginning is sweet. The boys have saved the world, again, and its time to enjoy life. Dean gets his dog Miracle back &amp;mdash; possibly a gift from Jack. The boys find themselves at a pie festival, and Sam jokingly smashes pie in Dean&amp;rsquo;s face. Sam and Dean end up in a classic hunt, tracking down a vampire nest they&amp;rsquo;re able to research in Dad&amp;rsquo;s journal of all things, something we haven&amp;rsquo;t seen in a while. Sam and Dean call themselves Agents Singer and Kripke for the shows Executive Producer and Creator. Sam and Dean are aware of the fact that Supernatural is a show in another universe, so that&amp;rsquo;s an intentional meta-commentary. Except for the skull masks these vamps wear, everything is pretty standard hunting fare. They even have time to unveil the Impala&amp;rsquo;s trunk of weapons and poke fun at one of the sillier contributions &amp;mdash; some throwing stars.

(43, 'movie', 'the boss baby', '&lt;p&gt;WHAT PARENTS NEED TO KNOW Parents need to know that The Boss Baby is an animated comedy inspired by Marla Frazee\'s popular picture book. It addresses issues related to sibling rivalry (particularly an older child\'s fears that there will be less love after a new baby arrives) and has a fair bit of peril, though much of it is played for laughs. Expect chases, nick-of-time escapes, and plenty of slapstick confrontations between babies and children/adults. There are also potentially scary scenes imagined by 7-year-old Tim (attacking animals, creepy hallways, looming figures) and a sequence in which two kids investigate a mysterious dark room and subsequently get captured. Not surprisingly for a film about babies, there\'s also plenty of body/potty humor, including an explosive fake-barf sequence, bare baby bottoms, and use of words like &quot;fart,&quot; &quot;poop,&quot; and &quot;doody.&quot; Other language includes some insults, and there\'s a scene in which it\'s implied that Tim tried a Long Island Ice Tea and didn\'t like it (champagne is also served in first class). The way the movie treats puppies -- like a factory-produced product -- may bother some viewers, and the fact that the boys travel to Las Vegas on their own may need some explaining ... as will the movie\'s take on where babies come from. But there are clear messages about the value of teamwork and the fact that there is enough love for everyone in a family. And parents who loved Alec Baldwin in 30 Rock will surely laugh (Boss Baby is basically a mini Jack Donaghy).&lt;/p&gt;', 'img/upload/test@test.com/96c97f296d2ac4f3907f297c26d50a7c.jpg', '2017', 40, 45, '2021/11/03', '{\"like\":0,\"dislike\":0,\"memberLike\":[],\"memberDislike\":[]}', 0, 1, NULL);
